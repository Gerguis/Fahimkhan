    <!--Here is a title of the website. Quite straightforward, this appears in the tab at the top of the page.-->
    <title>Web Dev!</title>

  <body>
    <!--Some header tags used <h1> and <h2>. They both have different sizes in the browser-->
    <h1>Welcome to this channel!</h1>
    <h2>Purpose of the channel in general...</h2>
    <!--The <p> tag is used here to make paragraphs. This helps when working with different text, later in css-->
    <!--Noticed how I've used two additional tags within the <p> tags? <em> is basically to put emphasis on something by making it italic-->
    <p>This website will go through the different <em>elements</em> and <em>aspects</em> of building a <strong>website</strong>.</p>
    <!--Here I've underlined the word however using the <u> tag-->
    <p>There are many things we can do with html. For example we can write two identical sentences, <u>however</u>...</p>
    <!--<b> tag was used before but this is not used anymore and has been replaced-->
    <p><b>This one is semantically wrong</b></p>
    <!--<strong> tag is now the correct way of writing words in bold/strong text-->
    <p><strong>This one is semantically correct</strong></p>
    <p> Confused? Feel free to go to the source code for a better explanation. Rule of thumb.. if there is anything later down the line like the above confusing 
       statements, then check the <u>comments</u> in the <strong><em>source code</em></strong> to understand better!
    <p>
    <p>Another cool thing you can do using html is h1 to h6 header tags. See how the sizes compare!:</p>
    <h1>This is the <strong>h1</strong> tag in effect!</h1>
    <h2>This is the <strong>h2</strong> tag in effect!</h2>
    <h3>This is the <strong>h3</strong> tag in effect!</h3>
    <h4>This is the <strong>h4</strong> tag in effect!</h4>
    <h5>This is the <strong>h5</strong> tag in effect!</h5>
    <h6>And finally, this is the <strong>h6</strong> tag in effect!</h6>
    <p>Now Lets check out what lists look like..</p>
    <p>This is an ordered list: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Fania</li>
      <li>Dave</li>
      <li>Fahim</li>
      <li>Captain Biceps</li>
      <li>Blah Blah</li>
      <li>You get the point :)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This is an unordered list: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fania</li>
      <li>Dave</li>
      <li>Fahim</li>
      <li>Captain Triceps</li>
      <li>Blah Blah</li>
      <li>Again, You get the point :)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a list of nested lists. This is just to demonstrate that you can nest lists within lists. I like to call this a crazy list because it's just crazyyy..</p>
    <!--Here we have an unordered list within which resides 2 ordered list, and in those nest a further 2 unordered lists. Crazy or what!-->
    <ul>
      <li>Fania</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Dave</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Fahim</li>
              <li>Captain Pecs</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
        <li>Blah Blah and more Blah</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Again, You get the point :)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Or atleast I hope you do lol</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
    </ul>
    <p>I think we need an image here.. too much text and not enough pictures makes me angry. Kinda like this guy!: </p>
    <!--Notice how the following image tag doesn't need a closing tag.. cool eh?-->
    <!--The first source[src] is a jpg file residing in the folder and the other one is a link from the image which is hosted on a server and available on the internet
        That's the difference between the two images!-->
    <img src="angrydoggo.jpg">
    <img src="https://www.polyvore.com/cgi/img-thing?.out=jpg&size=l&tid=12660460">
    <p>If you're confused as to why there are two images.. well you know what to do [hint: Ctrl + u] :)</p>
    <!--I've just added a link to google here and wrapped the word 'here' in the tags to make it the link.-->
    <p>Now, let's be silly and assume you didn't like the above cute doggo pic. Feel free to click <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/">here</a> to search one for yourself!</p>
    <p>Ladies and Gents, I present to you... a table:</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Strength Level</th>
      </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Superman</td>
            <td>34</td>
            <td>Can turn back time!</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Hulk</td>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>Breaks Worlds!</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Goku</td>
            <td>42</td>
            <td>Over 9000!</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Here is the same table but with a border so you may see it better. I've just used this to show you guys but practically we would use css for this.</p>
    <!--It's bad practice to use the border tag here as all aesthetics should primarily be done using CSS, it's just for example purposes to show the 
       table a bit better-->
    <table border="1">
      <thead>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Age</th>
        <th>Strength Level</th>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Superman</td>
          <td>34</td>
          <td>Can turn back time!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Hulk</td>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>Breaks Worlds!</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Goku</td>
          <td>42</td>
          <td>Over 9000!</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
	
	<p>Have you ever seen a form so amazing as this one?.. Check it out!:</p>
	<form>
	<!--Here the input is within the form, the type is which type of input the user can put into the boxes and the placeholder is to help the user 
	understand which box is for what.-->
	  <input type="text" placeholder="username">
	  <input type="password" placeholder="password">
	  <input type="submit">
	</form>
	<p>Same form but with more accessibility!:</p>
	<form>
	<!--Here is the same form but with labels instead of just placeholders. The users with sight impairment can better navigate when filling out a form
	with label tags as software that aids them uses the label tags to find and fill out the form.-->
	  <label for="username">Username:</label>
	  <input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username">
	  <label for="password">Password:</label>
	  <input id="password" type="password" placeholder="password">
	  <input type="submit">
	</form>
	<p>Form with validation coming right up...</p>
	<!--Here is a form which validates the user input and only proceeds if the validation criteria is met. The key word is required which is a boolean 
	and it tells the browser that the data is required in the form in order to submit it. Try it out! -->
	<form action="http://www.google.co.uk/">

	  <input type="submit">
	</form>
	<p>Radio buttons, Checkboxes and Dropdown menu's!:</p>
	
	<!--The radio button requires a name to connect all the radio buttons together so the browser knows that if one is selected another one can not be selected.-->

	  <p>What is your gender?</p>
	  <label for="male">Male</label>
	  <input name="gender" id="male" type="radio" value="MALE">
