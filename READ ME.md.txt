
I've started my web development project and this is my first entry. I've put 
together the barebones and now am going to fill it in with content according 
to my plan and sketches. 
I decided to first build a website called seasons4u but I then thought it would 
be a good idea to show the different aspects of HTML5, CSS AND JavaScript. So I 
have written a few different pages explaining the different stages or elements 
that a website usually contains. Most of the work done was taught to me by university 
or I learned online using resources like youtube, w3schools website and textbook.
