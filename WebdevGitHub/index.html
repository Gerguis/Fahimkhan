  <!--Here is a title of the website. Quite straightforward, this appears in the tab at the top of the page.-->
    <title>Web Dev!</title>

	<!--Some header tags used <h1> and <h2>. They both have different sizes in the browser-->
    <h1>Welcome to this channel!</h1>
    <h2>Purpose of the channel in general...</h2>
	
	<!--The <p> tag is used here to make paragraphs. This helps when working with different text, later in css-->
	<!--Noticed how I've used two additional tags within the <p> tags? <em> is basically to put emphasis on something by making it italic-->
    <p>This website will go through the different <em>elements</em> and <em>aspects</em> of building a <strong>website</strong>.</p>
	<!--Here I've underlined the word however using the <u> tag-->
    <p>There are many things we can do with html. For example we can write two identical sentences, <u>however</u>...</p>
	
	<!--<b> tag was used before but this is not used anymore and has been replaced-->
	<p><b>This one is semantically wrong</b></p>
	<!--<strong> tag is now the correct way of writing words in bold/strong text-->
	<p><strong>This one is semantically correct</strong></p>
	<p> Confused? Feel free to go to the source code for a better explanation. Rule of thumb.. if there is anything later down the line like the above confusing 
	statements, then check the <u>comments</u> in the <strong><em>source code</em></strong> to understand better!<p>
	
	<p>Another cool thing you can do using html is h1 to h6 header tags. see how the sizes compare!:</p>
	<h1>This is the <strong>h1</strong> tag in effect!</h1>
	<h2>This is the <strong>h2</strong> tag in effect!</h2>
	<h3>This is the <strong>h3</strong> tag in effect!</h3>
	<h4>This is the <strong>h4</strong> tag in effect!</h4>
	<h5>This is the <strong>h5</strong> tag in effect!</h5>
	<h6>And finally, this is the <strong>h6</strong> tag in effect!</h6>
		
	<p>Now Lets check out what lists look like..</p>
	<p>This is an ordered list: </p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Fania</li>
	  <li>Dave</li>
	  <li>Fahim</li>
	  <li>Captain Biceps</li>
	  <li>Blah Blah</li>
	  <li>You get the point :)</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>This is an unordered list: </p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Fania</li>
	  <li>Dave</li>
	  <li>Fahim</li>
	  <li>Captain Triceps</li>
	  <li>Blah Blah</li>
	  <li>Again, You get the point :)</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>This is a list of nested lists. This is just to demonstrate that you can nest lists within lists. I like to call this a crazy list because it's just crazyyy..</p>
	<!--Here we have an unordered list within which resides 2 ordered list, and in those nest a further 2 unordered lists. Crazy or what!-->
	<ul>
	  <li>Fania</li>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Dave</li>
	        <ul>
	          <li>Fahim</li>
	          <li>Captain Pecs</li>
	        </ul>
	    </ol>
	      <li>Blah Blah and more Blah</li>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Again, You get the point :)</li>
	        <ul>
	          <li>Or atleast I hope you do lol</li>
	        </ul>
	    </ol>
	</ul>
