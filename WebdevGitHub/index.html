	<h1>This is the <strong>h1</strong> tag in effect!</h1>
	<h2>This is the <strong>h2</strong> tag in effect!</h2>
	<h3>This is the <strong>h3</strong> tag in effect!</h3>
	<h4>This is the <strong>h4</strong> tag in effect!</h4>
	<h5>This is the <strong>h5</strong> tag in effect!</h5>
	<h6>And finally, This is the <strong>h6</strong> tag in effect!</h6>
